# A basic Static File Server <br>
It just serves web page files and nothing else <br>
It is based on the code at <a href="https://beej.js/guide/bgnet/html/split/client-server-background.html#a-simple-stream-server">guide/bgnet/html/split/client-server-background.html#a-simple-stream-server</a> using the <a href="https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/examples/server.c">server.c code</a> example. <br>
The <a href="https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/examples/server.c">server.c code</a> example is for a basic tcp/ip server. All that same code is found in this project's tcp folder. <br>
This repo includes a basic programming for adding the http protocol. The http programmng is in the http folder. It serves websites only and nothing else<br>
Next I may write a caching for the home page route, URI and POST data parsing code, and cookie get/set code.
